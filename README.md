**AMAZING NUMBER GUESSING GAME**

**Description:**

Welcome to the Amazing Number Guessing Game! This is a simple console-based Java game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.

**Features:**

- Randomly generated target number within a specified range.
- User input validation to ensure guesses are within the valid range.
- Informative feedback to guide the player in making subsequent guesses.
- Score tracking for successful guesses.
- Option to play the game multiple times.

**How to Play:**

1. Run the program in a Java environment.
2. Follow the prompts to input your guesses.
3. Receive feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. Continue guessing until you either guess the correct number or run out of attempts.
5. Your score is displayed at the end of each round.
6. Choose to play again or exit the game.

**Game Configuration:**

- **Minimum Value:** 1
- **Maximum Value:** 100
- **Maximum Attempts:** 10

These values can be adjusted by modifying the constants `MIN_VALUE`, `MAX_VALUE`, and `MAX_ATTEMPTS` in the source code.

**Implementation Details:**

- The program utilizes the `Random` class to generate a random target number.
- Input validation is implemented in the `validateInput` method to ensure the user enters a valid integer within the specified range.
- The game is structured with a main loop to allow for multiple rounds of play.

**Dependencies:**

The game has no external dependencies and can be run using any standard Java runtime environment.
